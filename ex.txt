Tor: Onion Routing Hits the Big Time

The idea of onion routing is not new. In the past, however, attempts at developing onion routing networks have met with less than success. Performance, security, scalability, and incentive have, usually in tandem, brought previous attempts down. Tor, introduced in a self-titled paper by Roger Dingledine et al.,  is a so-called "second generation" onion routing design and implementation. It seeks to solve many of the problems that plagued earlier onion routers, and does successfully address many important concerns.

Onion routing is an abstract system of message routing in which a user performs multiple layers of encryption on a message prior to sending it. As the message travels through a known set of routers, each router "peels off" a layer of encryption to which it alone is privy. When the message arrives at its destination, the only remaining encryption is removable by the user on the other end of the pipe. Tor improves upon simplistic onion routing by achieving full forward secrecy, using a standardized TCP application protocol (SOCKS), lowering overhead by multiplexing TCP streams through single circuits, improving congestion control, and a wide array of other things. Onion routers themselves can be run by volunteers and configured to those volunteers' specifications, allowing the network to grow indefinitely without centralized effort. As of 2004, Tor is an available product, running on machines around the world. Its creators have seen their arguments justified by widespread adoption of those arguments and the product they created.
